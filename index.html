<p>Dear Reader:</p>
<p><strong>The head of the FED just revealed something <em>bigger</em>…</strong></p>
<p>more <em>devastating</em>…</p>
<p>and more <em>catastrophic</em>…</p>
<p><u>than the recession of 2008.</u></p>
<p><strong>For most <u>Retirees</u>, it will explode like a financial <strong>Debt Bomb</strong>.</strong></p>
<p>And it’s so close, you can almost smell the gunpowder.</p>

<h2>It promises to devastate retiree’s the worst</h2>
</div>

<div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">
<p>&#8230;More than working Americans.</p>
<p>And cut deeper into your finances than anything else we’ve seen since the <u>Great Depression</u>.</p>
<p>I feel so strongly about this critical warning…</p>
<p>It concerns me what will happen when I let even a little of this information out into the world.</p>
<p>I’ve labeled this a “<strong><u>CONTROVERSIAL VIDEO”</u></strong>.</p>
<p>But honestly, that doesn’t seem strong enough.</p>
<p>Before I go any further, I must warn you, angry mob liberals will not like what I have to say…</p>
<p><u>Most Retiree’s will find this hard to believe</u> until they see all the facts as presented by a leading expert… advising banks, corporations and elected representatives.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why, before I go any further, I have to say&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>What I am going to tell you is shockingly controversial.</strong></p>
<p>In fact,</p>
<p><em>It will deeply offend many Democrats and globalists, alike.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already received dozens the worst kind of hate mail from these democracy haters.</p>
<p>Now&#8230; the ideas and solutions I&#8217;m going to present might seem too conservative to you at first&#8230;</p>
<p>…perhaps it may even offend your own family – But remember these are also the very people you’ll be using this secret information to help protect.</p>
<p><strong>Trust me, they’ll thank you later.</strong></p>
<p>Some people have started to read this letter and felt <em>lightheaded</em> part of the way through.</p>
<p>The brutal reality staring them in the face was <em>just too much to bear</em>.</p>
<p>Others have had to read it and digest it a bit at a time… because the information you’re about to see revealed for the first time here… can definitely make you <em>feel very anxious</em>.</p>
<p><strong>As you read this letter&#8230; you&#8217;ll say: &#8220;There&#8217;s no way this could happen here.”</strong></p>
<p>But just remember:</p>
<p>No one believed me four years ago when I said, <u>“shots will be fired”</u> in the largest trade war the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>And no one believed me when I shared a <u>secret memo</u> from the world’s largest bank.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>It warned of the exact time the greatest social unrest in over 50 years would come to <u>Retirees</u>’ neighborhoods…</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I keep this secret bank memo under lock and key in my vault to this day…</strong></p>
<p>No one believed me when I sat on a panel with a Pentagon insider (and Fox News host) warning the <strong>Debt Bomb</strong> will be triggered by a mass dump of U.S. treasuries by the <u>Chinese</u>.</p>
</div>

<p>I&#8217;ll explain more about this later… and why it’s critically important to you and every American <u>Retirees</u>&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>In short, this crisis will threaten our retirement way of life.</strong></p>
<p><em>The savings of millions of seniors may be wiped out sooner than we thought.</em></p>
<p>Decades of hard work and savings gone before you can catch your breath.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>This disaster will change your home and your plans for retirement. It will devastate your savings accounts, destroy your investments. And evaporate your retirement plan.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will change everything about your normal way of life: where you <em><u>vacation</u></em>&#8230; if you spend time with your <em><u>grandkids</u></em>&#8230; how and when you go to <em><u>church</u></em>… and if you’re going to <em><u>protect your family</u></em> and home.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll explain how I know these events are about to happen with <em><u>absolute certainty</u></em> from the leading experts.</p>
<p>You can decide for yourself if myself and the rest of my Republican colleagues are telling you the brutal truth.</p>
<p><strong>In fact, I challenge you to do your own research.</strong></p>
<p>We want independent minded people.</p>
<p>So don’t just take the word of me and my Expert Advisors.</p>
<p>I have complete confidence in what I’m revealing to you here.</p>
<p>You’ll see that I believe in this information so much that this is <u>where I’m putting my own hard-earned wealth.</u></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>I&#8217;m more certain about this looming crisis than I&#8217;ve been about anything else in my entire life.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am literally afraid for my <em><u>grand children’s future</u></em>, and I have taken drastic steps to prepare for what I know will inevitably happen next.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s outside the mainstream.</p>
<p>But they didn’t fare so well in the last financial crisis, did they?</p>
<p>How do you think they’ll do in the next one that’s far worse?</p>

<p>We all know that those <u><em>Obama</em></u> bailouts have had terrible consequences on the efforts of our Trump administration.</p>
<p>And, unlike most of the pundits on TV with their fake news, my Republican Advisors and I know a lot about finance and banking.</p>
<p><strong>Finance and banking have been the focus of my life for decades. And the same is true of my Advisors.</strong></p>
<p><u>They are urging me to get this information out in the world as quick as possible.</u> Because this whole terrible situation is coming to a head much, much sooner than most <u>Retirees</u> think.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve turned down every request to run for political office from my Republican advisors.</p>

<p>I’ll take the time to walk you through the steps I use to protect my family, and to grow my money, (and how you can prepare as well.)</p>

<p><u>My name is Doc.</u></p>
<p>You may have seen my forecasts on Fox News, CNBC or in conversations with Pentagon insider Jim Rickards (among others.)</p>
<p><u>I have assembled a secretive Republican panel known simply as “the Advisors.”</u></p>
<p>These advisors occupy positions as high as the Fed, top banks and brokerages, indeed all the way up to the U.S. Senate and leading newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>What these Republican Advisors have revealed to me will chill you to the bone…</strong></p>
<p>So much so, they have asked me not to reveal their identities until the “<strong>Debt Bomb X-Date</strong>” is officially reported.</p>
<p><em><u>In short, our comfortable way of life as <u>Retirees</u> in America is about to change drastically – I am absolutely certain of it!</u></em></p>
<p>In this letter I&#8217;ll show you exactly what “the Advisors” have revealed to me, and why it is inevitable.</p>
<p>Most American’s won&#8217;t know what to do when banks close&#8230; and their credit cards stop working.</p>
<p>Or when they&#8217;re not allowed to buy gold or hold paper currencies.</p>
<p>Or when brokerages fail&#8230; or their pension checks come to a halt.</p>
<p><strong>Will you be paralyzed by fear?</strong><br />
<strong>Or will you know what to do?</strong></p>
<p>You can challenge every single one of these facts from the Republican Advisors.</p>
<p>In fact, I encourage you to.</p>
<p>But you&#8217;ll find that they are always right about each allegation they make.</p>
<p>As one American senior to another, I truly hope you&#8217;ll take action for yourself.</p>
<p><em><strong>I’m praying you do.</strong></em></p>
<p>Will you act now to protect yourself and your family from the <strong>Debt Bomb</strong> that banks warn will affect our way of life forever…</p>
<p><em><strong>I’m praying you do.</strong></em></p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why I wrote this letter.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m going to walk you through exactly what I am doing personally, and what the Advisors have done as well.</strong></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t promise you&#8217;ll emerge from this <strong>Debt Bomb</strong> completely unharmed – but I can guarantee you&#8217;ll be a lot better off than people who don&#8217;t follow my simple, common sense advice.</p>
<p>But let’s take a step back for one moment.</p>
<p>I’m getting a little bit ahead of myself.</p>
<p>I’ll let the Advisors show you, in the common sense terms, what’s really going on, why they are so concerned, and <em><u>what they believe will happen, possibly even before your next distribution check</u></em>…</p>

<h2><strong>Is The “Debt Bomb X-Date” The Greatest Danger America Has Ever Faced?</strong></h2>
</div>
</div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">
<p>I believe that we as seniors are about to see a major, major <strong>Debt Bomb</strong> in our system.</p>
<p>Basically, what if I told you there was a <u>$233 Trillion <strong>Debt Bomb</strong>, that is set to blow</u>, and the <u>Chinese</u> are holding the switch!</p>
<p>Again&#8230; I say these things based on information from my Republican advisors who are experts in accounting and financial research.</p>
<p>You may not think things are… “THAT BAD”… in the U.S. economy right now.</p>
<p>And you’re right, but consider this simple fact.</p>
<p>One of the advisors just revealed on CNBC that</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>China</u> is holding a $1.2 Trillion weapon called a “kill switch…”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, this <u>kill switch</u> could be used to detonate U.S. Treasury bonds.</p>
<p>Honestly, because of the information I know, I think of them as U.S Treasury BOMBS.</p>
<p>It all started with the <u><em>Obamas</em></u> and Clintons joining forces to sell the <u>Chinese</u> over $1.2 trillion is U.S. treasuries over the past decades.</p>
<p>Simply put, you can thank <u><em>Obama</em></u> for arming the <u>Chinese</u> with enough U.S. debt that they can weaponize it any time.</p>
<p>The <u>kill switch</u> is in their hands. They’re just waiting for the worst possible moment.</p>
<p><strong>And KABOOM!</strong></p>
<p>Then all the TV pundits and fake news spokesmen will blame President Donald Trump for the $233 Trillion <strong>Debt Bomb</strong> explosion.</p>
<p>In reality, it was the liberals arming <u>China</u> with the one thing that could bring our great country to its knees.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-955 aligncenter my-4" src="https://www.retirementinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CHINA.jpg" alt="" width="947"></p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">
<p>When <u>China</u> decides to dump all those U.S. bonds in a fit of rage aimed at President Donald Trump,</p>
<p>“It could cause major havoc on retirements.” That’s what, Jeff Mills, co-chief investment strategist at PNC Financial Services Group said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly something they could do,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Thanks to <u><em>Obama</em></u>, it will also become insanely expensive for the U.S. government to issue debt — It will have to pay higher rates to borrowers like Greece or Venezuela, crippling the growth of our economy irreversibly.</p>
<p><em>Equities would be sent crashing</em>, too, out of desperation as the yields climb.</p>
<p>&#8220;Higher interest rates would ripple through the entire economy,&#8221; said Jeff Mills, PNC investment genius..</p>
<p>When this happens, <u>China</u> will hit the switch, and dump ALL their decades of U.S Treasury bond holdings.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">
<p>Yet the media isn’t reporting on these facts.</p>
<p>Normally I study these kinds of numbers when I&#8217;m looking at a business to invest in or when I&#8217;m talking to my group of Advisors.</p>
<p>But lately the <em>alarms have been ringing so loud my ears hurt</em>. As a result, I&#8217;ve spent most of my time looking into our national balance sheet.</p>
<p>At first, <em>what I saw terrified me</em>. I wasn’t able to sleep for two days.</p>
<p>I used that time to dig deeper and deeper into the numbers. Something no one else I know has done – Except for me and my Advisors.</p>
<p>Here’s just a little of what was revealed to me…</p>
<p>And now to you.</p>
<p><u>When the banking system collapsed in 2008, all of that debt was absorbed by the world&#8217;s governments.</u></p>
<p>When Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collapsed in the summer of 2008, the U.S. government responded by simply guaranteeing all of their outstanding debt.</p>
<p>Since then these companies have recorded hundreds of billions of losses – all of which were <u>passed along to the US government like a grenade with the pin out</u>.</p>
<p>We as Americans inherited these losses and trillions more in other private obligations… from the <u><em>Obama</em></u> era.</p>
<p>The problem is, governments around the world do not clearly publicize their overall net worth.</p>
<p>This creates a potential blind spot for policymakers who could use this knowledge to head off economic risks</p>
<p><u>But they won’t.</u></p>
<p>Even by my most conservative calculation (with my ability to get numbers directly from the Congressional Budget Office) a default on this debt by the U.S. government is absolutely inevitable.</p>
<p>This default is what is what insiders refer to as the &#8220;Debt Bomb&#8221;. And <u>China</u> is waiting for the right time to push the <u>kill switch</u>…</p>
<p>And when they do, it will set off chaos only comparable to the panic and crash of 1929.</p>
<p>In a new report, the International Monetary Fund said, “The net worth of the United States has been in decline. Worsening notably due to the global financial crisis, it had sunk by 2016 to negative 17 percent as a share of GDP.”</p>
<p>The federal mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which the government took over during the crisis, have lent a staggering amount to the private sector &#8212; <u>44 percent of GDP</u>.</p>
<p>But <u>the biggest source of risk for Retirees</u> comes from state and local government retirement pensions, which can lose money when Wall Street sinks &#8212; meaning the shortfall has to come out of local government budgets.</p>
<p>Towns and states then have to cut spending elsewhere, creating a drag on the economy.</p>
<p>Nationwide, such pension funds are already underfunded by about eight percent of GDP.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve now been left to pay the bill. And <u>the government is going to be looking for money it simply doesn’t have.</u></p>
<p><strong>Most <u>Retirees</u> don&#8217;t realize the government has already set their sights on their retirement funds to help cover the debt.</strong></p>
<p>Just recently, Financial news leader MarketWatch published a terrifying article – <strong>“Why <u>Retirees</u> should feel very worried right now”.</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1115 aligncenter" src="https://www.retirementinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/marketwatch.png" alt="" width="671" srcset="https://www.retirementinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/marketwatch.png 671w, https://www.retirementinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/marketwatch-291x300.png 291w, https://www.retirementinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/marketwatch-600x619.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px" /></p>
<p><em>If you’re not worried, then you should be.</em></p>
<p>It warned <u>Retirees</u> like us how pensions and savings are under extreme stress.</p>
<p>It said, “All of this suggests that uncomfortable choices loom on the horizon… <strong><u>Your goal now is to make sure you’ll be OK</u></strong>”.</p>
<p>We all know people who suffered great financial loss.</p>
<p>If you are watching this, you don’t have to be next. There still may be time left. I’m going to show you what me and my advisors are doing to prevent being ‘another statistic’.</p>
<p>My Advisors are now warning me daily… of the very serious threats <em><u>staring at all American <u>Retirees in the face.</u></u></em></p>
<p><strong>Here’s just one insight I want to share with you.</strong></p>
<p>Even before this crisis, our government was deeply, deeply in debt. With each additional financial commitment, we sunk further and further into debt&#8230; closing in upon the moment that our country can no longer afford even the interest payments on our obligations.</p>
<p><strong>It’s an open secret… the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, actually said, “We’re not on a sustainable fiscal path – we haven’t been for many years.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pay attention!</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-959 alignright" src="https://www.retirementinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TRUMP_PRESS.jpg" alt="" width="404" srcset="https://www.retirementinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TRUMP_PRESS.jpg 510w, https://www.retirementinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/TRUMP_PRESS-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></p>
<p>That should be a stark warning to all of us – those words come from the Chairman of the Federal Reserve!</p>
<p>Powell went on to say that we are going into the Greatest Recession of all time.</p>
<p>That warning is worth repeating. The Chairman of the Fed said that “we are going into the Greatest Recession of all time.”</p>
<p><em>Doesn’t that make the hair on the back of your neck stand up?</em></p>
<p>He also said that because interest rates have been artificially low, for so long, it could “hobble” the economy when it crashes again.</p>
<p>Noticed he didn’t say “if” it crashes again… but <u>when</u>.</p>
<p>And don’t look for it to recover this time around.</p>
<p>Here’s just one shocking warning sign my Advisors informed me of, that you won’t hear anywhere else…</p>
<p>The government has been paying 2% for a 30-day Treasury note. That basically means the government is paying 2% for a 30-day loan.</p>
<p><strong>That’s like a big flashing neon sign saying, “The US Government needs a PayDay Loan”.</strong></p>
<p>Wow. <em>My heart skipped a beat</em> when I heard that. <u>That</u>… is a very scary sign, no doubt.</p>
<p>Here’s a <u>secret</u> you’ll understand, even though most politicians don&#8217;t:</p>
<p>As things stand now, the U.S. government can simply print dollars to pay for its bad debts. (It&#8217;s been doing so since March of 2009).</p>
<p>That might sound pretty good at first. Since we can always just print more money, what is there to worry about&#8230;?</p>
<p>Since the late 1990s we&#8217;ve been the world&#8217;s LARGEST debtor.</p>
<p><strong>Today, our government owes more money to more people than anyone else in the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And that was before the financial crisis!</strong></p>
<p>With all of these bad debts piling up, we&#8217;ve had to begin repaying our debts by printing trillions of new dollars. <em>Trillions… with a T</em>.</p>
<p>The impact of this is only just now beginning to be felt.</p>
<p>And once our creditors figure out what&#8217;s happening, they&#8217;re going to be very angry.</p>
<p>Guess who owns almost one third of all of America’s foreign owned debt? <u>China</u>.</p>
<p>Notice how they’re name keeps popping up in the facts about <strong>“Debt Bomb X-Date&#8221;</strong>?</p>
<p>Remember that. Because in just a minute I’m going to tell you how the current trade war with <u>China</u> could lead to a <u>real war</u>.</p>
<p>And the first bomb to explode in that war will be the <strong>Debt Bomb X-Date</strong>.</p>
<p>Recently, the Dow Jones suffered it’s 3rd worst drop in American History. The next day, another huge drop.</p>
<p>Why? Because the Fed is starting to raise rates on all that debt!</p>
<p><u>Will it recover?</u> If it does, my Advisors and I are absolutely certain that it will only recover for a short period of time.</p>
<p><u>I’ve been sounding the Air Raid Alarm on the <strong>Debt Bomb&#8217;s</strong> burning fuse</u> for a long time now. Finally, other people are starting to smell the burning gunpowder.</p>
<p>A lot of people were surprised by that <em>historic bloodbath</em>, but not me or my advisors. Not one bit. We consider it a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>A warning shot to alert us to serious matters to come.</p>
<p>In fact, Fox Business recently published an article saying Trump Considers The Federal Reserve His Biggest Thread.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-962 aligncenter mb-4" src="https://www.retirementinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DONALD_TRUMP.jpg" alt="" width="947"></p>
<p>In another article, this one featured on MarketWatch, Trump openly says <em>“the Fed has gone crazy”</em>.</p>
<p>How bad do you think it is when the country of the United States is calling The Federal Reserve crazy and a threat?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all going to come to a head soon. Much sooner than most people think.</p>
<p><u><em>Don&#8217;t believe me?</em></u></p>
<p>In fact, <u><em>it&#8217;s already happening</em></u>&#8230;</p>
<p>The first steps are already well underway. It is happening right now&#8230; before our very eyes.</p>
<p><strong><u>I can&#8217;t stress this enough:</u></strong> You need to act now in order to protect your assets, and grow your savings in the next few years.</p>
<p>In the next few minutes, I&#8217;m going to reveal to you details most <u>Retirees</u> don’t know about their saving accounts.</p>
<p>And what I recommend you do with your own.</p>
<p>But first, let me show you exactly what’s going on right now&#8230;</p>
<p>When you read the following facts, I know you&#8217;ll agree with me that the fuse is burning down fast on the <strong>Debt Bomb X-Date</strong>.</p>
<p>The 10-year Treasury note yield climbed to a 7 year high. Just so you know what that is… it’s used to price everything from mortgages to car loans. And <u>it has in Trump’s words, “gone loco”</u>.</p>
<p>JPMorgan analysts noted that Investors pulled $5.4 billion from high-yield bond funds… the second-biggest withdrawal on record.</p>
<p>The Guggenheims’ Scott Minerd, the firm&#8217;s Global Chief Investment Officer, who manages $265 billion dollars in assets… Said <em>“the US economy is like the Titanic — moving at full steam, with an iceberg ahead.”</em></p>
<p>(Let me remind you that 68% of the people on the Titanic died an ugly, frozen death.)</p>
<p>“Our work is showing us that <u><em>the stock market will probably pull back at least 40 percent</em></u>”… and that’s just the start.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Minerd said the market was <em><u>on a &#8220;collision course with disaster&#8221;</u></em><br />
Bloomberg said, “The Next Financial Crisis Is Staring Us in the Face”.</p>
<p><strong><u>I’m astounded by the expertise my Advisors deliver to me on a daily basis.</u></strong> I believe it is unmatched, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The information I receive from them every day wakes me up more than the strongest cup of coffee.</p>
<p>They reminded me that buried deep within the legal code are provisions that grant the government emergency economic powers that allows them to close stock exchanges, shut down ATMs, freeze money market funds, forbid asset managers from selling your securities – even if they’re suddenly falling through the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Think that can’t happen?</strong></p>
<p>In 2011, over 38,000 clients found themselves <u>frozen out of their own accounts</u> when brokerage MF Global collapsed.</p>
<p>Can you imagine how scary it would be to be watching a financial collapse all around you, and to be trying to sell your securities, only to learn that you could NOT sell them?</p>
<p>That’s why they’re called “frozen”.</p>
<p><em>Imagine if you could NOT get cash from your accounts for god-knows-how-long</em> – if at all.</p>
<p>Do you see where this is all heading?</p>
<p>I will let you in on one of the secrets of the little known Republican IRA. A very unique type of IRA specifically constructed to make sure that your money is <u>far more protected</u> than those kinds of accounts.</p>
<p>We’ve done a lot of research and this Republican IRA has made sure there are <u>layers upon layers upon layers between you and the government’s greedy hands.</u></p>
<p><strong>The smartest investors are taking action&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>These investors know there are serious, serious problems with the U.S. Debt.</p>
<p>The good news is, no matter what happens, I&#8217;ve found several ways for you to protect your savings – and <u>you could even make 3- to 5-times your money over the next few years.</u></p>
<p><strong>The <u>REAL</u> State</strong><br />
<strong>of the U.S. Economy</strong></p>

<p>I know many of my friends, colleagues, and family members are still in serious denial.</p>
<p>In the world of psychology, they call this the &#8220;normalcy bias.&#8221;</p>
<p>You see, the normalcy bias actually refers to our natural reactions when facing a crisis.</p>
<p>The <strong>normalcy bias</strong> causes smart people to underestimate the possibility of a disaster and its effects.</p>
<p>In short: People believe that since something has&nbsp;<em><u>never&nbsp;happened</u></em> before&#8230; it&nbsp;<em><u>never will</u></em>. We are all guilty of it&#8230; it&#8217;s just human nature.</p>
<p><strong>The normalcy bias also makes people unable to deal with a disaster</strong>, once it has occurred. Basically&#8230; people have a really hard time preparing for and dealing with something they have never experienced.</p>
<p><strong>September 11th and the Twin Towers is a powerful example of normalcy bias.</strong></p>
<p>People just couldn’t imagine America being attacked. 9/11 was so far outside “normal” even people inside our intelligence communities couldn’t “connect the dots”.</p>
<p>Or maybe they didn’t want to.</p>
<p>How could they not?</p>
<p>There were plenty of <em>danger signs</em> and <em>warning signals</em>.</p>
<p>(Much like now. In fact, some members of our Advisors were “insiders”. They shouted at the top of their lungs about the obvious danger signals leading up to 9/11. But were ignored. This letter is part of refusing to be ignored again.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Normalcy bias” is a well-researched psychological phenomenon.</p>
<p>We simply refuse to see the evidence that&#8217;s right in front of our face, because it is unlike anything we have experienced before.</p>
<p>No matter how loud it’s <em>shouting</em>, we close our ears.</p>
<p>No matter how bright the <em>danger signals</em>, we close our eyes.</p>
<p>The normalcy bias kicks in&#8230; and we continue to go about our lives as if nothing is unusual or out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>Well, we&#8217;re seeing the same thing happen in the United States right now.</p>
<p>We have been the world&#8217;s most powerful country for nearly 100 years. The U.S. Debt has been just a minor annoyance for a long time.</p>
<p>Until it’s not!</p>
<p>Most of us in America simply cannot imagine these things changing. But <strong>I promise you this: Things are changing&#8230; and faster than most people realize.</strong></p>
<p>For a moment, just look at a tiny fraction of the evidence around us&#8230;.</p>
<p>I just read a Bloomberg article that mirrored everything I’ve been shouting about the <strong>Debt Bomb X-Date</strong> at the top of my lungs. It said…</p>
<p>“The current run-up in U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar poses a major stress test for a global financial system.”</p>
<p>“… A stronger U.S. dollar and the global cost of capital rising is the perfect cocktail, in our opinion, for a liquidity crunch”.</p>
<p>“as the global economy and financial system have become more systemically leveraged, their sensitivity to changes in the cost of global capital has increased; hence, we believe the next downturn may be more serious than previous ones.”</p>
<p>If anything, as usual, the media is soft-pedaling the real news so as not to scare you.</p>
<p>All they care about are ratings. They don’t want you to turn away.</p>
<p><em>Well, I’m not here to scare, I’m here to make you aware!</em></p>
<p>This is just unbelievable to me&#8230;</p>
<p>Once again, it&#8217;s taxpayers like you and me who will be left holding the bag.</p>
<p>Unless we take action. Unless we say NO, we won’t let that happen again!</p>
<p>Here’s a shocking piece of information my Advisors clued me into.</p>

<h2>** IN THE STOCK MARKET, IT&#8217;S 1937 ALL OVER AGAIN</h2>
</div>
</div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">
<p>One of the most worrisome problems in the stock market right now is that we are basically repeating the exact same situation that occurred from 1937 to 1942.</p>
<p><em>Tell me this news doesn’t send a shiver up your spine.</em></p>
<p>Most Americans think we&#8217;ve had this amazing stock market recovery since the financial crisis of 2008&#8230; and we have… to a certain extent.</p>
<p>But we are by no means out of the woods.</p>
<p>In fact, during America&#8217;s last real economic collapse, in the 1930s and 1940s, we saw a similar drop and recovery&#8230; before the markets crashed all over again.</p>
<p><strong>In fact, the situation today is eerily similar.</strong></p>
<p>Look at this chart&#8230; it&#8217;s one of the scariest I&#8217;ve seen in a long time. It shows an overlay of what happened in the stock market in 1937 compared to 2008.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-1121 aligncenter" src="https://www.retirementinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crashes-1024x708.png" alt="" width="1024" srcset="https://www.retirementinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crashes-1024x708.png 1024w, https://www.retirementinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crashes-300x207.png 300w, https://www.retirementinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crashes-768x531.png 768w, https://www.retirementinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crashes-600x415.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>In both situations, we saw HUGE crashes, of about the exact same magnitude&#8230; then a big recovery, again of about the same size.</p>
<p>But what will happen next?</p>
<p>Well, if history is any guide, we could well have another big leg down in the stock market. That&#8217;s exactly what happened 80 something years ago.</p>
<p>And with all of the problems left unresolved in our economy today, it’s destined to happen again when the <strong>Debt Bomb X-Date</strong> explodes.</p>
<p>As The <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, a newspaper that was around during the Great Depression, reported: &#8220;…The stock market has followed a path eerily similar to 1937.”</p>
<p>“First, a strong, rapid run to a recovery high – same pace, same magnitude. Then a correction – again, the same.”</p>
<p>Will we continue on the path that led the correction of 1937 to turn into an even bigger crash?</p>
<p>The point is, the data points to a frighteningly similar set of circumstances.</p>
<p>This looming currency crisis is inevitable.</p>
<p>We have borrowed an impossible amount of money, which we&#8217;ll never be able to pay back.</p>
<p>Our economy is an absolute mess.</p>
<p>Think that can’t happen in this day and age?</p>
<p>President Trump doesn’t sugar-coat the truth like the media does. He tells it like it is in an OP-ED he wrote in USA Today and reported by Sean Hannity… Trump said <strong>“Radical Democrats Want to Turn USA into VENEZUELA”</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-968 alignright" src="https://www.retirementinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/VENZUELA_DEBT_CHART.png" alt="" width="413"></p>
<p><strong>I warn you, this is an ugly, cruel vision of reality – that’s already happening.</strong></p>
<p><em>Don’t turn away</em>. I’m about to reveal what a SMALL <strong>Debt Bomb</strong> explosion will look like.</p>
<p>Better you read about it here than experience it in your near future with <strong>Debt Bomb X-Date</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Venezuela is in a crushing debt crisis. (Sound familiar?).</strong></p>
<p>In order to pay the bills, Venezuela began printing more money. (Sound familiar?)</p>
<p>The biggest foreign Debt holder for Venezuela is <u>China</u> – just like it is for the US.</p>
<p>Venezuela’s massive debt crisis forced them to sign awful unfair, one-sided financial agreements with <u>China</u>. (Again, notice how <u>China</u> plays a worrying part in all of this news about debt.)</p>
<p>The economy is so bad in Venezuela that their government recently knocked 5 zeros off their currency. That’s right, <strong><u>5 ZEROS.</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Imagine waking up one morning and discovering that your $100,000 American dollars were suddenly worth a pitiful $1 dollar.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imagine a day when your One Million Dollar retirement money was now worth $10.</strong></p>
<p>Can you even imagine how completely devastating that would be to every aspect of your life?</p>
<p>Well, Venezuela is a good example. But nowhere near the catastrophic level I believe you’ll see from the explosion of <strong>Debt Bomb X-Date</strong>.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, even if you have money, there’s almost nothing to buy. The shelves are all but empty in so many places.</p>
<p>These <u>massive food shortages</u> have forced starving Venezuelans to cross over into neighboring countries just to buy food.</p>
<p>But don’t just take my word and my Advisor’s word, listen to the people living there.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“I’m afraid to go outside. There are thousands of anti-government protesters in the street. At least 75 people died in the recent protests”</em> ~ Jofram Gallipoli</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>“Now I spend all my time trying to fend off hunger. A tube of toothpaste cost a half a week’s wages. So I only brush my teeth before I go to sleep. But not in the morning.”</em> ~ Ana Margarita Rangel</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>“I have to stand in line for 14 hours to just to get some basic foods, pasta, rice, flour.”</em> ~ Eduardo Valero</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>“Every two weeks, I walk 15 kilometers to go to a little market and buy about two pounds of sugar, a pound of milk powder and nine pounds of broken-grain rice that smells of bird food. We used to use it as chicken feed. Now we season it with meat scraps and bones and eat it ourselves”</em> ~ Romer Sarabia</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>“I’m starving most of the time. I buy groceries for my family but try not to eat but once a day. I’ve lost 24 pounds in the last six months. I stopped playing soccer… “I can’t afford to burn calories or wear out my sneakers”.</em> ~ Rainer Figueroa</p></blockquote>
<p>Life has gotten so desperate, 6% of the population of Venezuela has been forced to move to another country.</p>
<p>The United Nations called it “one of Latin America’s largest mass-population movements in history,”</p>
<p><u>Just stop for a moment and imagine</u> when the <strong>Debt Bomb X-Date</strong> causes the same out-of-control situation to happen here in America.</p>
<p>20 million Americans would have to move to another country to survive.</p>
<p>People who’ve taken the time to listen fully and learn the secret information I have to offer won’t have to move anywhere.</p>
<p>In fact, they could probably thrive and do even better in those perilous times.</p>
<p><strong>Pay Attention! This is information known to only a handful of people in the entire world.</strong></p>
<p>And I’m prepared to share it with <u>you</u>, PRIVATELY.</p>
<p>It’s information from experts you won’t find anywhere else on the planet. Not from anybody. Not even the world’s top intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>It’s the only solution I know of to avoid the coming catastrophe. It’s where I’m putting my personal wealth to protect it. <u>And</u> to actually make money in these coming catastrophic times.</p>
<p>It almost seems like the <u>Chinese</u> conducted a test <strong>Debt Bomb</strong> detonation in Venezuela, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>A small rehearsal to see how to practice executing their plan.</p>
<p>And to learn what will happen when they do the same to America.</p>
<p>So they can better take advantage of the situation they created.</p>
<p><strong>Remember… <u>China</u> owns 29% of Americas foreign owned debt! And that debt has been weaponized.</strong> All they have to do is hit that <u>kill switch</u> and we’ll have an instant liquidity crisis the likes of which the world has never seen before.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-972 alignright" src="https://www.retirementinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/FOREING_DEBT_GRAPH.png" alt="" width="375"></p>
<p>President Trump is fearless and courageous. He’s has challenged <u>China&#8217;s</u> unfair agreements in front of the whole world.</p>
<p><u>China</u> has been taking hundreds of Billions of dollars out of our country and stealing our intellectual property.</p>
<p>Trump has been the only President with the guts to stand up to them.</p>
<p>And <u>China</u> is absolutey furious about it.</p>
<p>A Pentagon report says <u>Chinese</u> bombers are training for strikes deep inside the US.</p>
<p>With nearly a million troops, the <u>Chinese</u> Army has the largest ground force in the world.</p>
<p>This report said that <u>China</u> is developing its nuclear capabilities.</p>
<p>And vastly improving already formidable high-tech hacking operations.</p>
<p>Forbes magazine published an article titled <strong>“<u>Chinese</u> Cyber Attack Could Shut Down U.S. Electric Power Grid”</strong>.</p>
<p>In the article, “the head of the National Security Agency and the U.S. Cyber Command… warned that <u>China</u>… had &#8220;the ability to launch a cyberattack that could shut down the entire U.S. power grid… &#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Can you imagine what would happen to our financial and banking system if that happened? Can you imagine what might happen to your own financial health if that happened?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Business Insider said, “Tensions are rising in the <u>South China Sea</u>, and a US ally there has already drawn &#8216;red lines&#8217; with <u>China</u>”.<br />
“A <u>Chinese</u> destroyer approached a US Navy ship — getting as close as 45 feet — in what Navy officials called an &#8220;unsafe and unprofessional maneuver.&#8221;<br />
Things have gotten so tense, President Trump’s Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called off TWO senior-level meetings in a single week because <em>&#8220;The tension is escalating…&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>My Advisors have information that tells me The Pentagon Is Planning a Three-Front ‘Long War’ Against <u>China</u>.</p>
<p>They also have secret information about <u>China&#8217;s</u> own massive debt problem – <u>China</u> has defaulted on 20% of their <u>own</u> bonds.</p>
<p><em>More scary proof</em> that it won’t be long before <u>China</u> hits the <u>kill switch</u> on US debt – so they can deal with their&nbsp;<u>own</u> debt crisis.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING: You have to start to deal with this <u>today</u></strong>. For yourself. For your wealth. For your family. For the life you want to continue living. <u>Nobody else is coming to help you</u>.</p>
<p>As far as protecting your family&#8230; well&#8230; it depends on your circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>If you live in an urban area, I recommend making sure you&#8217;ve got somewhere safe you can go in case there are riots or food and water shortages.</strong></p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a very good chance we&#8217;ll see that in the next two years.</p>
<p>Wherever you&#8217;re going to wait out the chaos, <strong>I recommend you have basic food, water, and medical supplies to last you for at least six months.</strong></p>
<p><em>Remember, you won&#8217;t be able to count on the government during this crisis.</em></p>
<p>And as I said earlier, the truth is, the government won&#8217;t even try to save individual American citizens&#8230; the government will be much more concerned with saving itself.</p>
<p>I’m sure by now you understand the truth about the <strong>Debt Bomb X-Date</strong>. It’s a real and pressing CRISIS that has to be dealt with – Immediately.</p>
<p><strong><u>You have no choice. You must take action.</u></strong></p>
<p>One way or another, we will all have to deal with this coming catastrophe.</p>
<p>But what should you do?</p>
<p><em><u>In any crisis, the first immediate step is to make sure you and your family are safe.</u></em></p>
<p>Being safe comes from knowing the facts – knowing for certain if your money is safe.</p>
<p><strong>So how do you get the facts?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, here’s some good news…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting the facts – the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">REAL</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> facts, just got a whole lot simpler.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Advisors and I have taken our hundreds of years of collective expertise…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">thousands of hours of intensive research…</span></p>
<p><b>and a treasure trove of insider secrets…</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and boiled it down into a book you can easily read in a single sitting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The title says it all…</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The End of Retirement: How China Holds the Kill Switch for America’s $233 Trillion Debt Bomb”</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within these pages is everything you need to know about how this happened, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">why it’s happening, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">when it’s happening, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><b>why it will have its most severe and devastating impact on Retirees.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the most important information in my new book tells you how to protect your wealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And how to even grow your wealth during the coming terrifying times.</span></p>
<p><b>All that for just $129.95?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow, is right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People tell me every day how </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">valuable</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this information is to them and their family.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wish you could hear some of the stories people tell me about what my new book has meant to their life… their retirement dreams… and their peace of mind.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If “Knowledge is power”, this information is pretty close to priceless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many, many, many people have told me how grateful and blessed they feel to have access to this secret and valuable information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EVERYONE tells me my new book is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">worth so much more</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than its $129.95 price tag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I want you to get the information you need to know NOW so you can deal with this fast-approaching catastrophe. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time is running out.</span></p>
<p><b>You need to take action NOW.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask yourself,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Would I know what to do if all my retirement money was frozen in my bank?”</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Would I know what to do if China uses cyberwarfare to shut down the entire American Electric Grid… and all the ATMs in America quit working?”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is more than a book. It’s a manual for how to survive and thrive in the cataclysmic times that are almost upon us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thought shocks me into action every time I think about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why I’ve decided to let you get your copy for just $79.95</span></p>
<p><b>That’s right, just $79.95.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t really imagine anybody who’s paid attention to what I have to say so far would hesitate to get their copy of this book for $79.95.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who on earth wouldn’t want to ensure the golden retirement future they’ve dreamed of?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t tell you how many people have told me they wish they had this kind of powerful insight and information </span><b>BEFORE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the 2008 Financial Crash. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine how many billions (maybe even trillions) of dollars could have been saved by people who had such brilliantly researched guidance back then?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you imagine how many people could LOOK BACK NOW and say, “I wish I’d had the chance to spend $79.95 </span><b>BEFORE THE 2008 CRASH</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and prosper during that time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even better, </span><b>imagine how much you could save NOW by protecting your wealth from Debt Bomb X-Date</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And in fact, you could actually make money during this catastrophic time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine if you could get your hands on that information, </span><b>BEFORE our greedy government gets their hands on your money. &nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t make my money from selling books. I make my money from knowing how to protect and invest my wealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So &#8212; look… this is going to cost me money but I sense that if you’ve stayed with me this far, you fully understand what’s about to happen. </span></p>
<p><b>So I’m actually going to let you purchase a copy of “The End of Retirement” for only $49.95. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel so strongly that I have to get this information out there to Retirees… this is my mission, not how I make my money. So yes… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a VERY LIMITED TIME… You can now order your copy of</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The End of Retirement: How China Holds the Kill Switch for America’s $233 Trillion Debt Bomb”</span></i></p>
<p><b><i>To ORDER… Just click on the button below this video!</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because you’re a good friend of the Republican Insider, I really want you to have it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if I lose money at just $49.95.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Me losing a little bit of money on my book is so much better than you losing a lot of money because you don’t have my book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve had many people tell me that the information in this book saved them hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So by taking action NOW, and ordering my chocked-full-of-wisdom and common sense book, you could actually be saving a </span><b>HUGE</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amount of money (as our President Trump likes to say). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t like to brag, but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Advisors aren’t just good, they’re the best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am very, very proud of the amazing amount of </span><b>retirement-rescue</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;information we have been able to put into so few pages. </span></p>
